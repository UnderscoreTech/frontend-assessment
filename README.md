# Front-end code assessment

> The following document describes the front-end assessment and all the requirements of it.

You will build two pages for a Lottery. Both pages have a different usage, but both require to fetch data and display it.

- A user page displaying some data and the option to buy a ticket
- An admin page displaying some data and the option to generate a winner
